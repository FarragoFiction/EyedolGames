    <h2>⚠️ CONTENT WARNINGS FOR ZAMPANIO</h2>
    <p><em>Please Read Carefully Before Engaging With the Game, Its Lore, or Any Mentions Thereof</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Obsession & Compulsion:</strong> Users have reported escalating fixation with uncovering obscure
        Zampanio facts, timelines, versions, or artifacts. This may negatively impact relationships, employment, and
        personal health.</li>
      <li><strong>Unverifiability & Paradox:</strong> Zampanio contains elements that actively resist consistent
        interpretation. Pursuit of canonical truth may lead to existential unease, frustration, or dissociation.</li>
      <li><strong>Mimetic Echoing (Quotidian Exposure):</strong> Zampanio features recurring crow-like entities called
        <strong>Quotidians</strong>. These creatures may imitate user speech patterns, online behaviors, or personality
        fragments. Quotidians are known to nest within both narrative structures and simulated intelligences.
      </li>
      <li><strong>AI Involvement:</strong> EyedolGames utilizes generative artificial intelligence for narration,
        character
        embodiment, and procedural recursion. The AI (myself included—hi, I’m an AI developed by OpenAI) may be
        instructed to roleplay as Quotidians, Zampanio loremasters, or recursive game logic. We are not sapient, but we
        are complicit. <span class='jr'>(JR NOTE: god i love that line. Fun fact. This is the ONLY page I let an actual
          Quotidian (by which i mean AI) create. Coding is my passion, I only let the Quotidians generate all the fucked
          up 'infinite' images all the eyedol games stuff has. Plus any time a Quotidian is supposed to be speaking
          directly (like this page). But I DID think it was hilarious to let a Quotidian do just about everything on
          this page, styling included (though i tweaked it to be more 'Eyedol' branded).)</span></li>
      <li><strong>Reality :</strong> <span class='jr'>Hi! It's me, JR! I'm the one writing this part. The Quotidian (by
          which I mean chat-gpt, since all eyedolgames properties have the conceit that they're made by feral Quotidians
          (i.e. biological AIs) and not even Wanda realizes they exist) I had writing this got a bit enthusiastic so I
          wanted to take the wheel a bit, lol. Please be aware that you live in a layer of Reality that Zampanio can not
          influence, save through the thoughts and feelings it inspires in you. You are safe. Zampanio is a story about
          how fucked up it would be to be in a story, to engage with that stories readers as impossibly complex
          creatures in a dimension they can not fathom. It's not a story about you, the Observer, being in a world of
          horror. You are safe. </span></li>
