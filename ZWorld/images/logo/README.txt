One on of my super powers is my relentless sense of confidence.

I see myself in Camille in that way?

For some reason I woke up today introspecting about that. Trying to sort out in my head how I would tell someone about it.

So, here I am, having, as my new clown friend put it "the world's most interesting diary" throes.  Most people will never find this. Even future me might not remember doing this and stumble into it again. 
But it matters that it COULD be seen. Always does.

So, here's current me's thoughts on why I'm so confident.  (Interestingly, optimisticDuelist seems to have a similar source of confidence, as detailed here: https://www.tumblr.com/jadedresearcher/721008181821800448/hey-rd-what-settled-you-in-on-your-god-tier?source=share  and i only found it the day after I wrote this (but I've been avoid adding this to git till i have a lot of other things to post at the same time so the casual glance does not reveal this))



The first thing you need to know about me is that my parents favorite passtime is tearing down everyone around them and punishing 'weirdness'. 

Add on the fact that I was adopted, and my birth family had a history of childhood schiphrenia and lower intelligence (both of which ended up missing me) and you get a fairly strong tendency towards them to tear me down.

Any way I diverged was a sign I was corrupt, that I was destined for evil. 
In kindergarten my mom said I'd "grow up to be a serial killer" which is a normal fucking thing to say to a five year old when they express anger.

I was called stupid or worthless any time I didn't think the same way they did. I was called cruel or selfish any time I didn't do exactly what they wanted.  
And both were applied to me any time I got so happy I forgot about consequences.



And then... contrast that with school. 

School treated me like some kind of miracle. Teachers praised my intelligence. My creativity. My kindness. 

They treated me like one of those therapy dogs they place with cheetahs to calm them down. Multiple times in elementary school they'd pair me with a new kid (especially a new kid with some form of disability) so I could show them the ropes and befriend them.

They had me go to all the different classes to tell everyone how to write books. 



And I hoarded that praise like an ant preparing for winter.  I memorized it and nibbled at it during lean times. I learned, oh so slowly, to counter the things my parents said, at least in my mind, with the things the teachers said. 

It wasn't all praise, of course.  Middle school especially exposed me to teachers who sat me down and told me I was annoying, or called in my parents to express 'concerns' that I was drawing gory images.  That fucked with me!



But still. School was a source of authority figures petting me, figuratively speaking.



A lot of people I know were bullied at school, which leads me to another prong of my confidence:  I have an almost total inability to parse aggression.  I just sort of assume everyone is friendly and likes me?

It's one of the many reasons why I'm unsure if I'm on the autism spectrum or if it's just, you know, the childhood trauma. 

In RETROSPECT, I realize that several people ATTEMPTED to bully me, as a child. 

But I would just... genuinely respond positively to attention? And that would confuse them. Sometimes that resulted in actually befriending them. Sometimes not. 

Partly I think it was that aggression just didn't register to me unless it involved shouting or physical violence, since that was the standard provided by my parents. 

By middleschool I had at least one experience of realizing real time I was being bullied, but that was only after apparently months of it failing to register.
The bully got so upset at me that she just started shoving me and yelling about how I wasn't her friend. She lost friends for doing that in front of them, and they took me in. 

It was weird.



Highschool brought new challenges, since we moved states entirely.  I made friends slowly. People started to call me cute, the way you'd call a small friendly dog cute. It was nice? Especially because tearing down my appearance was one of the family hobbies.



School and academia as a source of confidence culminated in me getting some kinda award for having the highest SAT score in the county. TECHNICALLY I'd tied with one of my friends, but they had shit grades because they couldn't focuse so they were disqualified. 

When I got the award, I had to name a teacher who had Most Influenced me. 

I tried to name my science teacher, because she was that good mix of strict and silly I responded well too, but the adult on the phone said she'd won the award too many times and could I choose someone else. (what the fuck?)

So instead I went for my english teacher, who i'd had a few years in a row so I could actually remember her name on the spot. Plus, it was my best subject. 


Little did I know how much that would do for my confidence? 


The county newspaper interviewed her and she had the most flattering fucking things to say about me, things I didn't even know?  (I am p sure my old angelfire had a scan of the article but I couldn't find it anywhere. probably for the best, cuz that would dox me)
She expanded on them during the award ceremony, too.

I hope I've mentioned before, but I have face blindness.  It's one of the reasons I'm so friendly towards everyone, because I never know who anyone is, so may as well assume friend. 

So I didn't know that actually she was the very first person I MET at my new school.


I had been in the gifted program for awhile, and apparently different states have different standards for that?  So when I got to the new state they had to retest me. 


I wasn't terribly worried about it, of COURSE I was gifted, that was like, the one theme every teacher agreed on. Even those who made me cry were quick to praise my intelligence. 


So I mostly just treated the IQ tests like any other.  Mostly forgot about it. 

But to HER, who was the proctor for the test it was the BIGGEST DEAL EVER.


In the article, she talked about how IRRITATED I had made her. 

Because CLEARLY I was not taking any of this shit seriously. 

I was pulling out a BOOK mid test and just reading for pleasure. 

She wasn't worried I was cheating cuz the test would just flat out be closed and the pencil down and I'd not touch it again. 

So, she's starting out irritated at me, assuming I'm some punk.


Then, she goes to grade the test. 


And I score the only perfect score in english-adjacent stuff she'd seen in like, thirty years of giving this test. 

And my math scores were well over what I needed as well. 

And then she goes back and realizes that most of my reading had been during the english part.  That I wasn't just smart but I *knew* I was smart. I was confident in my answers and saw no reason to second guess them. 

And when I was doing LESS well, in the math stuff, I knew that too and accurately judged I needed to pay more attention. My confidence was ACCURATE.


So she spent the next FOUR YEARS of my life extremely aware of who I was and keeping an eye on me even as I had NO clue who she was.


And hearing that story was just. 

*extremely* confidence boosting. 

But not just "oh hey I am so super smart"?  What she had to say about my CONFIDENCE really stuck with me. 

Made me start going "i am a confident person". Which only increased the effect. 




And the very next thing I did was escape my family and go to college. 

There was some bullshit there that exploited the hole my parents had left in me, the little voice saying I'm bad and worthless. 

Got in me deep, too. 

But once I escaped THAT as well what was left was someone who knew how to hoard confidence boosters and ignore haters. And I haven't yet encountered a hater strong enough to give my parents or the college bullshit a run for their money.


So I just am rampant, unchecked confidence. 

Which, as I said, is a super power.   (And also probably my downfall!)

I know so many super talented people who are *terrified* at the idea of showing their creations to the world?

Or who insist on polishing polishing polishing so its PERFECT?

And I'm just.... absolutely fine having half finished works that aren't even spell checked escape into the wild.

Like, at least half of how quickly I create things are a function of how little I worry about how they'll be recieved. 

VERY obviously the things I create are Not For Everyone. 



I'm just Confident that it'll resonnate with those who it's meant for, you know? 

Those rare few who dig in all the same spots my brain generates, who enjoys the types of things I enjoy? 

Just by being here, you're connected. Both with me, and with everyone else who has found this. 

THAT'S what Zampanio is to me.

This idea that we are all connected through our mutual love of anything calling itself "Zampanio". 

Soem of us will just dig and dig and dig and never be Seen. 

Some will dig and shine a light for others to look around with. They'll document what they find and make it public. 

Others will Create. They'll expand the network with branches of their own. They'll take what they've found in their diggings and leave things behind for others to dig into.

And all of this is valid!

Seen or unseen, creating or consuming, we are all here, in this place, across so many different times, together.





And that's all I need to keep creating.
