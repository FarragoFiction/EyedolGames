    "You must choose."
The great wyrm Nidhogg looms over the slight young troll. Its dark scales gleam even in the dim light. Despap's eyes are green-rimmed and wide; their face has a look of crazed joy.

"No."
They float up to Nidhogg's eye level with barely a flick of their wings. Despap reaches up and pulls the crown of roses from their hair, then places it atop the wyrm's great head. 
"Instead I give the Choice to you." 
They lean forward to press a kiss to Nidhogg's forehead, below the garland. Vines or roots can be seen beginning to grow down, the tendrils latching into the serpent's flesh. As Despap pulls back, a rose buds, then blooms from where their lips were. The flower opens wide, and an eyeball can be seen in its center, rolling wildly.
"*Open your eyes,*" murmurs Despap.

Everything begins to shake and break up as the great wyrm thrashes and screams in the throes of its transformation.
