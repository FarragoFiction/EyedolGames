  <p>JR here. </p>
  <p>I think a lot about the past. </p>
  <p>Today I want to think about horror. </p>
  <p>Partly because I might be doing a horror colab.</p>
  <p>If you've dug enough you might have an idea of its flavor. </p>
  <p> <br></p>
  <p>The thing is...  </p>
  <p>I almost never parse my OWN work as horror? </p>
  <p>At least not before ZampanioSim. </p>
  <p>Zampanio is clearly a creepy pasta, so you gotta keep the vibes up in your fanwork. </p>
  <p>But I would routinely be surprised when people found sburbsim spooky.</p>
  <p>Or at least the secrets of it. </p>
  <p>Granted, I have an extremely high tolerance for horror. We'll get to that in just a second. </p>
  <p>But I think also I get so excited at finding a narrative hook that I don't stop and think of any given beat objectively? </p>
  <p>GHOA was *horrific* as an example (and if you don't know what that is, happy hunting). But all I could think about was how neat it was how clean the story that glitch made.</p>
  <p> <br></p>
  <p>So circling back to my extreme tolerance for horror. </p>
  <p>When I was in first grade, I read every single Nancy Drew book, because my mom collected them. </p>
  <p> I was ravenous. I was smart.</p>
  <p>So, when I ran out of those, just around 7 or 8, my mom gave me what few OTHER books she had. </p>
  <p>Namely, Stephen King and for some reason the novelization of Jaws. </p>
  <p>And they were JUST BOOKS to me. They were stories and I wanted more and more and they went so much faster than kids books.  </p>
  <p>Sure, there were parts I had to skip cuz it was boring, gross adult stuff, like sex scenes or whatever. </p>
  <p> But the sheer JOY I experienced at getting to READ overpowered it all.</p>
  <p>When I was in fourth grade, I remember we had some awards ceremony. Kinda thing most kids got at least SOMETHING so we all had self esteem.  </p>
  <p>And the award I got was for writing. </p>
    <p>See, my school had this lil thing where if you gave them some pages they'd bind it for you all official like. </p>
  <p>We were allowed one free a year so I did it EVERY year. </p>
  <p> I was actually the first kindergartener to use the system, apparnetly, with my book entitled "Squirmy Worm Likes to Play".</p>
  <p>They had me go to each kindergarten class and read my story to them and explain how it got bound and that they could do this too. </p>
  
  <br><p> (This may be one of the reasons why I am so comfortable with public speaking and trying to convince folks to join me in doing things)</p>
  <br><p>In any case, I got an award for writing, and when the teacher gave it to me she said, in this weirdly dry tone, like there was a joke I wasn't in on, that one day my name would be up in lights. </p>
  <p>Later, I found out that the TYPES of stories I kept turning in for her class unsettled her.  </p>
  <p>She thought I had a lot of talent. Might even be the next Stephen King. But did I NEED to keep writing murder mysteries with unreliable narrators where weasles pop out of chests with still beating hearts?</p>
  <p>Elementary school me would get excited about things and just GO with it, you know? </p>
  <br><p>In middle school, though, two different things happened to temper my enthusiasm. </p>
  <p>It turns out that when people KNOW that i am the "spooky 8 year old who writes horror stories" it's a charming quirk I have. </p>
  <p>But when my 7th grade science teacher who knows nothing about me catches me doodling severed limbs and heads on my homework she calls a parent teacher conference. And says I am going to be a school shooter. </p>
  <p>And my Math teacher takes  me aside and tells me I was annoying everyone. </p>
  <br><p>SO, I shut my trap and stopped telling people what I was reading or having an outward personality at all. </p>
  <br><p>You know how it is. </p>
  <p>Silently reading a book and if anyone asks what I'm reading I just show them the cover. </p>
  <p>Spoke with an entirely flat affect, though that was also partly my home life. Not gonna go into THAT now, that's not the point. </p>
  <p>I got compared a lot to "Daria", from some MTV show I'd never heard of but immediately tried to track down.  </p>
  <p>I liked being compared to anyone. </p>
  <p data-jrnote="i do that still...I'm always looking for what I have in common with everyone, which tends to get translated as relatively high charisma? I genuinely want to know people and understand them and in so doing understand myself">I was adopted, you see, so I was always looking for connections to strangers. </p>
  <p>This person has dark hair like me, this person has interests like me, this person, this fictional person apparently speaks like me. </p>
  <p><br> </p>
  <p> They weren't even wrong, it was kinda funny.</p>
  <p> <br></p>
  <p> So, when I get to highschool, I take a class that teaches me how to do a bit of webcoding.</p>
  <p>Make a shitty angelfire site.  (some wastes know what it is, some don't, its not important)</p>
  <p>And get OBSESSED with it. </p>
  <p>Suddenly here was this context where no one could tell me I was annoying or creepy! </p>
  <p><br> I opened up like a flower.</p>
  <p>Apparently my writing from back then is still being used as a slightly cringe copy pasta these days. </p>
  <p>Hooray immortality. </p>
  <p>The site was a bit spooky (standard early web black bg and red font, as one does). </p>
  <p>But mostly I just wanted to LEARN and to WRITE.</p>
  <p><br><br> </p>
  <p>Thinking about it... </p>
  <p>I think my problem is I don't really parse ANYTHING as having a genre? </p>
  <p>It's just either something I'm hype about or something I'm not. </p>
  <p>When I was in like,third grade we watched the Princess Bride at my summer rec thing. </p>
  <p>And I was ANGRY at one of the counselers for LYING when he described it as a "comedy". </p>
  <p>It was NOT! </p>
  <p>I was adament on this. </p>
  <p>It was one of Two Movies my mom owned so I had watched it a million times as long as I could remember. </p>
  <p>It had boring/gross/embarssing kissing scenes. </p>
  <p> And ACTION.</p>
  <p>It had a guy in black who did a GIANT SWING which is what my Grandpa (who ran away and joined the circus when he was 14) had been doing the day he died (from a heart attack). </p>
  <p>It was NOT a comedy.</p>
  <p data-jrnote="similarly back when we still went to church, i must have been six, i argued with some other little kid who had said something about god and i said, disdainfully, that there WAS no god, didn't they know, we were CHRISTIANS, there was only jesus.  I was HIGHLY pendantic and VERY CONFUSED All the time that things could be two things at once. Glad we stopped going to church, though.">It was a MOVIE. </p>
  <p><br> </p>
  <p>You might not be surprised to find out I didn't realize movies COULD be bad until college. </p>
  <p>Everything was just. A story. And I loved stories. </p>
  <p><br><br> </p>
  <p data-jrnote="you know, i've been starting to wonder if i'm on the spectrum lately. harder to see as an adult with Maximum Freedom, but especially as a kid a lot of my problems were from just. thinking differently than everyone. its not as much a problem anymore cuz anyone who would be offended by this simply isn't in my life anymore">I learned that movies could have genres in highschool, though.</p>
  <p> I joined the Teen Advisory Board for my library so I could get volunteer credits for college applications.</p>
  <p>And the librian, Ms Vicki, was SO COOL. </p>
  <p> She was in charge of the teen department and wanted my help getting teens more active in the library.</p>
  <p>So, just like with Squirmy Worm, I went around to *everyone* and asked them to join. </p>
  <p>One girl had to get it in writing it wasn't a CULT I was trying to recruit people to because let me tell you, high school me knew that MYSTERIES were how you hook people. </p>
  <p>So I wouldn't tell people shit, just give them increasingly unhinged lies in a 'sign up form' on my shitty angelfire site and a time/date/place to show up at. </p>
  <p>Most of my friends joined, and a surprising amount of near strangers did, too. </p>
  <p>And we would do fairly generic things like shelve books, or help put on mini carnivals and paint faces for the kids. </p>
  <p>We'd have improv game nights for the middleschoolers and help wrangle them. </p>
  <p>But we'd ALSO, just us, the older teens, have horror movie nights and put on a haunted house every hallween. (Me and one of my friends were in an exhibit together and were consistently considered the spookiest part of it. I love acting!) </p>
  <p><br> </p>
  <p>It was like I finally had a place to belong.  </p>
  <p>I wasn't the only one in an entire school writing horror stories. </p>
  <p>I wasn't a monotone non-person hoping to be left alone. </p>
  <p><br> </p>
  <p>So I guess my point here is that... </p>
  <p>Horror has long been established for me as a means of connecting to other people. </p>
  <p>I love gathering up a small group of people and making sure an Experience happens, and my interactions with the Zampanio fandom have been the same.</p>
  <p>Honestly, I feel like a dying fandom is my natural habitat.  </p>
  <p>Homestuck had been too big, too...open? </p>
  <p> It's nice having a place to hang out where I can be a natural rallying point but NOT like, a moderator?</p>
  <p>It's nice that the horror context can let me provide warnings WITHOUT spoiling the mystery? </p>
  <p>The homepage is backgrooms themed now, and fucks up at midnight and friday. </p>
  <p>Hopefully that lets ppl know theres spooks ahead and maybe unreality. </p>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>Welp, gotta go. Got Arkham Horror to prepare for irl. </p>
  <p>But this was a nice way to get my thoughts out there in terms of horror.</p>
  <p data-jrnote="fun fact, this is why i have the reputation for secrets. because i want to talk and talk to hypothetical people but fear its 'annoying' so hide it away so theres a CHANCE someone might find it but its not like.... in their face.  I appreciate so much those of you who do find my secrets (especially when you're careful not to conflate 'things i put out there on purpose' and , you know, doxxing me)">I'm weird like that. I can't see my own thoughts unless theres a chance someone else can. Unless I feel like I'm CONNECTING with someone. Even if that someone is far far in the future.</p>
  <p data-jrnote="still not gonna go into family bullshit but...theres a reason why i crave being understood more than anything. my new clown friend wants to become an idea, to become ONLY the legacy. but thats not me. i want to be a person, even if one long dead, that you feel a connection to, however fleeting. when i was so so alone the internet made me feel these moments of connections with strangers, not real time, thats not how it was then, so im trying to leave that to you. this idea that, i'm maybe not a person anymore. maybe i'm dead and gone. but i stil exist right now and i still am connecting to you.">There's a REASON why I've been experimenting with Blood instead of Mind for my classpect, if those words make any sense to you.</p>
