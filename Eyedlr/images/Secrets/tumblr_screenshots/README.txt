not all these folders will end up used directly in Eyedlr.

So, if you found these, and you know the kind of bullshit I tend to do, good luck, have fun.

If this is your first time peeking behind the curtain, hi!!!  This is actually part of the game. The unused files are intended to be found here and now and add layers to the narrative.

There is no 'cheating' in this. 

The code is a branch, the source files are a branch, the git hub is a branch, my tumblr is a branch. Your path through my creations and the creations of the rest of the Zampanio fandom is itself a branch, even if you never share it with anyone.

Just beware. 

You'll drown in it.

There's too much. There's always too much. Always more. 

You can't just binge it all. Here, other places, wherever

Pace yourself. Take breaks. Do something else. 

Hydrate.

Obsession leads to you becoming a shell of your former self.

Don't let Zampanio claim another victim.
