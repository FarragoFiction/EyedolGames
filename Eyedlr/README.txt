don't forget that the images are hosted on farrago because for some reason no matter what i do eyedol isn't set up for CORS so i can develop locally


I am so very tired. 

I'm mid move right now. 

I did manage to get like, the basic skeleton of Eyedlr in place on a rest day we took. 

I ...hate how little physical activity I can do.  A few hours of packing or unpacking with plenty of breaks is about my limit for a whole day. 

I'm helping how I can. 

But what I can do leaves me so drained. 

Gotta go back to work monday, though. A week was absolutely not enough. 

KR was a huge help packing (thanks KR, if you ever read this!) and theres other sources of help, etc. 

but man. 

moving is huge. 

but worth it in this case. 

things will be easier in the new place. 

that's the hope.
