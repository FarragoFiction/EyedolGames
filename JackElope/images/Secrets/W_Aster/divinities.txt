`Of the Divinities, only the Immaculate makes no attempt to hide its Name. It has 7 syllables, each resonating with a fragment of the Speakers mind- though each burns the tongue more than the last. Pronounce them all, and earn a fragment of its attention.`

`The Splendid Veritarch became an Endless in the years of Alexander's Conquests, and bound himself to the Immaculate as soon as he could. Egotistical to the extreme, entire wings of the Alabaster Library have been dedicated to his theories on everything from metaphysics to metamagic to metapolitics.`

`The Daughter is pursued, always. Though her Burrow offers solace at times, its location must always move, before her Grandfather's hunters arrive.
