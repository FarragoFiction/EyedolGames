Light at night may be a sign of life on Earth, but the darkness will proclaim our true intelligence.", "Darkness can encompass a primitive chaos, and the powers of that chaos; it is not essentially evil, yet it is largely associated with death and destruction, captivity and spiritual darkness.", "The philosophy of darkness is very simple, it will not let you go towards light and it loves to keep everyone in darkness and at the end make brother fight brother.

", "Artificial hypotheticals have their place, but any conclusions they support must be tested against the messy reality of war.", "Any normative theory of war should pay attention both to what the laws of war should be, and to what we morally ought to do.
