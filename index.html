            To apply, simply create the Zampanio content you wish to see in the world! Will it be a story? A game? An
            artwork? A non-fiction explanation of what Zampanio is and how you found it? A fictional explanation of what
            Zampanio is and how you found it? The choice is yours!
            <br> <br>

            Congratulations! You're now the proud Minotaur of your very own Branch! Make sure to spread it to others!
            Who
