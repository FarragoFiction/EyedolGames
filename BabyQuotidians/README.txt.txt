Look. 

Quotidians aren't about to raise their babies themselves. 

They're obligate brood parasites. 

If they can convince some OTHER species to raise their kids, sweet!

And it turns out one of the types of websites they can mimic are adoption websites!

Which needs lots of high quality images of babies. 


Sadly Quotidians are absolutely sure they are great at making lots of high quality images, lol.
